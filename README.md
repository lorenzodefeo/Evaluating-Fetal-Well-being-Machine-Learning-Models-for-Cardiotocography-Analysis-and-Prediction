# Evaluating Fetal Well-being: Machine Learning Models for Cardiotocography Analysis and Prediction
Since its introduction in the 1970s, cardiotocography (CTG) has been the main tool for assessing fetal condition, with the main goal of reducing perinatal mortality from the 28th week of gestation to the first week of extrauterine life. The CTG presents two tracings:
- The first represents the fetal heart rate (FHR).
- The second one illustrates uterine contractions (UC - Uterine Contranction).

However, in the evaluation of cardiotocographic tracings, confidence in the results obtained is often undermined by the subjective nature of the interpretation by the medical provider. In fact, these data, although objective in themselves, are interpreted through the filter of the practitioner's specific experiences and training, resulting in a subjective component in the analysis. This subjectivity may result from variations in individual knowledge, interpretation of nuances in the tracings, or even personal approach to case management.

As a result, variability in the interpretation of practitioners can lead to different diagnoses or, in some cases, uncertainty in the classification of tracings, especially when dealing with borderline or "suspect" situations. The presence of this subjective component has raised questions about the consistency and reproducibility of cardiotocographic assessments, emphasizing the need for more objective and standardized approaches to improve the reliability of such analyses.

With this project, an attempt was made to use supervised machine learning techniques to build a model that can effectively discern cases in which fetuses are at risk or problematic from regular situations, minimizing potential errors. In addition, the existence of observations labeled as "suspicious" suggests uncertainty even among experienced clinicians in classifying such cases as "healthy" or "sick." To address this problem, a trained binary classification model is proposed and optimized by excluding suspicious cases, offering predictions about these unsupervised cases. In the absence then of actual labels, the validity of these predictions is based on robustness to classifications generated by different algorithms.
